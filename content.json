    "title": "About Bargheer Geophysics",
    "content": [
      "Bargheer Geophysics was started by Arne Bargheer in 2015 after he had been working 15 years with geophysics within the engineering and consultancy industry in Denmark. Geophysics in Denmark in this period had a huge golden age thanks to a groundwater mapping done by the danish state resulting in much resources being put into mapping the underground in Denmark, making the danish underground one of the best investigated in the world and in turn also generating in a lot of geophysical innovations.",
      "Arne has been involved in a big part of the danish groundwater mapping and is experienced in all the geophysical methods that have been used for this mapping and a broad range of other types of geophysics. Apart from groundwater mapping Arne has among other things been doing projects involving mineral investigations, oil prospecting, contamination mapping and geotechnical investigations."
